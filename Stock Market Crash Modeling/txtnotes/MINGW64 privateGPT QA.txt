 The three most important concepts discussed in this passage are (1) time inconsistency, which arises when individuals' beliefs and behaviors diverge due to changes over time; (2.5) basic truth of capitalism system's instabilities, as shown by its instability or weak links that suggest a fundamental underlying structure may be present for the whole theory on markets; (3).The author has cited examples about stock price fluctuations in different periods affecting people and economies differently due to various causes such as changes over time. He emphasizes one example where he mentions how stocks were priced based on expectations of future dividends, which changed throughout history causing a long-term impact that we can see today's high volatility still being present even after the adventof modern technology (3).

I think the prompt wasn't good enough but not entirely sure yet bc i do not think it has been a minute.

 The chapter "Time Inconsistency and Rational Choice" of Chapter 9 discusses how human preferences can cause problems with economic decisions due to their non-deterministic nature, as individuals may make choices that are inconsistent over a long period or in unpredictable situations (p115). One example given is the famous time inconsistency problem faced by agents playing auction games who do not update information about other players' behavior. The solution discussed involves incorporating additional parameters such as past performance and reputation into decision making to overcome this issue, although it may lead to higher complexity of models used for analysis compared with classical approaches (p118).
